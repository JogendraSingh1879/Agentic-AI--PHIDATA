# Agentic AI PHIDATA
**GitHub Repository Description:**

This repository contains a Python-based implementation of a **Multi-AI Agent System** powered by GROQS **llama-3.3-70b-versatile** model, designed to provide accurate and actionable financial insights. The system integrates two specialized agents—**Web Search Agent** and **Finance AI Agent**—to deliver comprehensive financial analysis and up-to-date market information. 

### Key Features:
- **Web Search Agent**: Performs targeted web searches to retrieve the latest financial information, verifies source credibility, and provides concise summaries with direct links to sources.
- **Finance AI Agent**: Analyzes stock data using **YFinanceTools**, displaying key metrics such as stock prices, fundamentals, analyst recommendations, and recent company news in a structured, tabular format.
- **Multi-AI Agent**: Combines the capabilities of both agents to generate cohesive, well-formatted responses, ensuring users receive a holistic view of financial data and market trends.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Google Gemini**: The core AI model for generating responses.
- **YFinanceTools**: For fetching stock-related data (e.g., prices, fundamentals, news).
- **DuckDuckGo**: For web searches to retrieve real-time financial information.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure management of API keys using `.env`.

### Use Case Example:
The system can process queries like:  
*"Summarize analyst recommendations and share the latest news for HDFC Bank Ltd."*  
It combines web search results with structured stock analysis, presenting the information in a clear, markdown-formatted response.

### Why Use This?
- **Enhanced Formatting**: Responses are structured with headings, tables, and clickable links for better readability.
- **Practical and Actionable**: Designed to provide concise, relevant, and verified financial insights.
- **Customizable**: Agents can be tailored to specific use cases or extended with additional tools.
