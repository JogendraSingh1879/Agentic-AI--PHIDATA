**GitHub Repository Description:**

This repository features a Python-based **Multi-AI Agent System** powered by **Groq's Llama 3.3-70b** model, designed to provide comprehensive financial insights and web-based information retrieval. The system integrates two specialized agents—**Web Search Agent** and **Finance AI Agent**—to deliver structured and actionable data.

### Key Features:
- **Web Search Agent**: Searches the web for relevant information using **DuckDuckGo**, ensuring all responses include verified sources.
- **Finance AI Agent**: Utilizes **YFinanceTools** to fetch and display stock-related data, including prices, fundamentals, analyst recommendations, and company news, presented in easy-to-read tables.
- **Multi-AI Agent**: Combines the capabilities of both agents to generate cohesive, well-formatted responses, ensuring users receive a holistic view of financial and web-based data.

### Tools and Technologies:
- **Groq Llama 3.3-70b**: The core AI model for generating responses.
- **YFinanceTools**: For fetching stock-related data (e.g., prices, fundamentals, news).
- **DuckDuckGo**: For web searches to retrieve real-time information.
- **Environment Variables**: Secure management of API keys using `.env`.
- **Playground**: A web-based interface to interact with the agents.

### Use Case Example:
The system can process queries like:  
*"Provide the latest stock data and analyst recommendations for Tesla (TSLA) along with recent news."*  
It combines web search results with structured financial analysis, presenting the information in a clear, markdown-formatted response with tables and sources.

### Why Use This?
- **Structured Outputs**: Responses are formatted with tables and include verified sources for transparency.
- **Practical and Actionable**: Designed to provide concise, relevant, and verified insights.
- **Interactive Playground**: A web-based interface allows users to interact with the agents in real-time.
